## Project: E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation-Project

## Description

Analysis of an `E-Commerce customer database` that lists purchases made by over 4000 customers over a period of one year, I developed a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a `new customer`, during the following year, from its first purchase.

## Overview

## Install
This project requires Python 3.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

You will also need to have the software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the `Anaconda distribution` of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.7 installer and not the Python 2.x installer.
